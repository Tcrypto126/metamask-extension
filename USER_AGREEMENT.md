# Disclaimer

**METAMASK is still Beta software. Do not rely on METAMASK to manage large amounts of Ether.**

## SECURITY WARNINGS

**You are responsible for your own computer's security. If your machine is compromised, you could lose your ether and access to your accounts and contracts.**

You are responsible for your own actions.

The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use of METAMASK and ETH and expressly agrees to not hold liable MetaMask or the MetaMask Team should any of these risks occur:

**METMASK AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS MEANT FOR DEVELOPERS OR PEOPLE WITH A UNDERSTANDING OF THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL. DUE TO THE NATURE OF METAMASK, THE METAMASK TEAM DOES NOT ADVISE STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF ETHER IN METAMASK VAULTS. THE METAMASK TEAM DOES NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOST OR STOLEN ETHER. BY CLICKING AGREE AND USING METAMASK THE USER UNDERSTANDS THE RISKS OF USING EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE AND ACKNOWLEDGES THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE BUGS OR SECURITY RISKS IN METAMASK THAT MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF ETHER AND THE METAMASK TEAM IS NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF LOST FUNDS.**

### Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions

METAMASK and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of METAMASK to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit the ability of User to use Ethereum Platform or ETH.

### Risk that METAMASK—As Developed—Will Not Meet the Expectations of User

The User recognizes that METAMASK is under development and may undergo significant changes. User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of METAMASK held by the User may not be met upon release of METAMASK, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of METAMASK.

### Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Cryptography is an art, not a science; the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and METAMASK, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, METAMASK intends to update the protocol underlying METAMASK to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any future security updates.

### Warning of the Volatility of Crypto Currencies

ETHEREUM is a new enough technology that the value of its core token and network fee currency is highly volatile, due to a combination of adoption and speculation.

METAMASK cannot be held responsible for increases in the cost of network resources that affect the viability of any business activities that may take place on the blockchain.

### Warning of Possible Accidental Flaws in Ethereum Apps

ETHEREUM applications are only as good as the code they are written with. METAMASK cannot be held responsible if you interact with a flawed contract. ETHEREUM applications are a very new kind of software, and people are still learning how to write fully bulletproof software, so you are responsible for evaluating the trustworthiness of the websites you are willing to submit Ethereum transactions to.

### Warning of Possible Malicious Contracts in Ethereum Apps

ETHEREUM applications can be written maliciously. METAMASK cannot be held liable if you choose to interact with a contract that does not perform as expected. A contract may keep funds sent to it, or even impersonate the person making a request of it. METAMASK developers will do everything they can to warn you of potential threats, but they cannot be considered omniscient, and so all liabilities of interacting with malevolent contracts must lie on the user.

### Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities

THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING METAMASK AND METAMASK AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGE AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, ETH PLATFORM AND ETH. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ETH OR METAMASK UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER METAMASK NOR THE METAMASK TEAM WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA.

### Acknowledgement of User's Duty to All Laws and Regulations

The USER is responsible for their own actions with the use of the METAMASK software. Like any tool, it could be conceivably be used in ways not legal in some jurisdictions.

THE USER agrees to adhere to all binding laws and regulations for the conditions in which they use METAMASK.

### Risk of Temporary Network Incoherence

METAMASK is not liable for unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of civil or military authorities, lack of energy, sickness or other ill health, injurious dance parties, rancid bacon, acts of Gods, Nymphs, Angels (fallen or otherwise) or Djinn, or any similarly unforeseen events that render misfortune.

The METAMASK DEVELOPERS wish the very best luck in creating a better life for yourself, those you love, and your greater community, the world.
